## About Me
Hello! My name is Brandon. I am currenly a 4th year student at NYU majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. This was created for my Open Source Software Development class (CSCI-UA 480) where I'll be updating my progress throughout the semester. 

I enjoy watching the English Premier League and other major football competitons so if I'm ever unreachable or late completing something, it's probably because I'm watching my club Tottenham Hotspurs. 

## Goals for Spring 2026

I'm excited to dive into some of my personal favorite open-source projects and contribute something. I got a lot of experience collaborating with teammates in a DevOps course and I'm excited to explore open-source projects with a new team.

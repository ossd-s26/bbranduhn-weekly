### Progress towards Open Source Project
[QuickHistory](https://github.com/ossd-s26/QuickHistory) allows users to efficiently summarize and delete their browsing data. 

After having used the Chrome for Developers resource to build my first browser extension, my team begun thinking about creative, yet simple ideas for this project. I had the idea to create a one-click button that deletes your most recent search to simplify the Chrome workflow, since the current process is tedious. Everyone had very different ideas based on their own interests but after considering the scope and complexity of each idea, mine was chosen. [Alan](https://github.com/Chen-zexi) came up with additional AI-powered features that provide brief summaries about the users search history, such as most visited and high-usage cached pages. 

Working on a MERN stack app in my Agile Software Development required leadership and communicaiton skills to succeed in a group of four. I was surprised by how easily those skills tranferred and helped improve the groups workflow. They made conversation flow more smoothly and made work delegation clear for anyone joining the project for the first time.

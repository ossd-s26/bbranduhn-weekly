### Git Exercises 
Before the Fall 2025 semester, I had very little experience using Git. I was enrolled in a DevOps course where I had to quickly learn  it's basic functions in order to work on a semester-long web application project. I used it every day and encountered common issues that taught me how to troublshoot problems and better understand version control workflows. However, the lecture on Git introduced command shortcuts that I wasn't previously using. 

### Project Evaluations
My group worked on investigating [Exorcism](https://exercism.org/), a free to use project that is meant to easily introduce students to various coding languages. Despite the user-friendly nature of the website, looking deeper into the repository showed how complicated and multilayered it is to contribute to such a large open-source project. Exploring the documentation and contribution workflow helped me understand the level of organization and structure required to maintain a project at this scale.

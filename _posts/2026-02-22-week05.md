### Group Presentations

Many groups created creative browser extensions, though none were tools I'd personally use on daily basis. Regardless, the projects were a great way to show how simple ideas can meaningfully improve a user's browsing experience. 

We created [QuickHistory](https://github.com/ossd-s26/QuickHistory), a browser extension that lets user their most recent or large portions of their search data without going through all the steps. I have a tendency to steer away from ideas just thinking about how multilayerd and complicated they can get. However, my teammates were great at coming up with a strong foundation to build on, and the process of adding features became very easy when I saw all the resources possible. 

Because our project was relatively small, our presentation felt much smoother than most of my past presentations. We introducing the idea, demo'd it, and were open to questions about how it worked under the hood. I typically get nervous when I'm not entirely confident about the information, which causes me to stutter or lose my train of though. I thought other presentations had small issues with timing, manuerims, and nervous laughter but I still struggle with that in other projects.
